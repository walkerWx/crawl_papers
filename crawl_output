More recently, extensions of these methods to large graph problems, data analysis, and image processing have gained much recognition. Most recently, he has developed a new computational method called systematic upscaling, which dramatically increases the speed and efficiency of computations for systems with a large number of variables. For example, it can speed up atom-by-atom simulations of polymer design by two orders of magnitude.
